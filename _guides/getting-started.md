# Getting Started In Whiteout Survival

This guide will help you understand the basics of the game and get you started on the right path for your main character. If you are
looking to start a Farm Character instead, check out the [Starting A Farm Guide](/) instead.

### State Selection

If you have friends in the game, make sure you are starting on the same State (also known as server) as them. Otherwise, just pick the
newest state so you aren't too far behind. If you happen to end up on an older State don't worry, you will catch up eventually.

## Day 1: The Tutorial

The tutorial will walk you through the basics of:
- Building your first buildings.
    - Upgrading those buildings
    - Adding survivors to work in the buildings.
- Setting your furnace to max power.
- Collecting mission rewards.
- Accepting new surivors into your city.
    - You can accept sick survivors, they won't cause you any issues.
- Use gems to speed up construction
    - Avoid doing this outside of when it forces you to in the tutorial. It's never worth it.
- Surviving snowstorms.
    - Your first 1-2 snowstorms will require you upgrading your Furnace to survive.
    - It shouldn't take you more than 10 minutes to get your Furnace and all of the buildings up to level 5 for your first storm.
    - After this, however, you can totally ignore this mechanic because you will well outpace it with Furnace growth.

By the end of the tutorial you will have completed Mission Chapter 2 and be at Furnace level 5.

There is no downside to keeping your Furnace set to max boost. Set it and just forget it.

### Heroes and Exploration

Exploration is a mechanic that opens along with Heroes at Furnace 4. You will use up to 5 of your Heroes to challenge enemy NPC squads of
increasing difficulty, getting Steel and other rewards. Steel is used heavily in researching new technology at later Furnace levels. Steel
is also used to increase the production of your Sawmill, Hunter's Hut, Coal Mine, and Iron Mine. Finally, Steel is used to increase the comfort level
of your Shelters to keep your survivors happier.

Once you have reached Exploration stage 5 you should enable Auto mode, and at stage 10 you should speed up using the 2x speed multiplier.
At stage 30 you get auto-continue, meaning you can ignore the game and let it autobattle new stages until you are no longer powerful enough to
continue.

It is imperative you collect your offline Exploration rewards as often as you can, and you push to the highest stage you can. Offline rewards cap
 at 7 hours, so try and hop on 3 times a day to collect.
{: .alert .alert-success}

You will have three different classes of Heroes:
1. Marksman, identified with a crossbow icon (example: Bahiti).
2. Lancer, identified with a spear icon (example: Molly).
3. Infantry, identified with a shield icon (example: Sergei).

When you are setting up Exploration squads, try and keep your Infantry heroes on the front line and your Marksman/Lancer heroes on the back line.

If you are sitting around for 3-5 minutes waiting for some construction to complete, hop back into Exploration and try to clear another 2-3 stages.
It's worth chunking them down until you get to stage 30 and auto-battle.
{: .alert .alert-primary}

### Spending Money
It's up to you if you want to spend money. It's totally possible to be Free to Play and contribute to a successful Top 3 alliance on your server.
You will never be the strongest without spending real money, but you can still be very successful.

If you choose to spend money, check out our guide on [the Best Early purchases](/) so you don't waste your money. Try to spend on longer term permanent
gains rather than short term speedups and resources.

### Day 1 Checklist

Your three most important goals for your first day playing are:
1. Get to Furnace 7 to unlock Alliances.
    - Join an alliance that is active enough that they can send you "Helps" to speed up your construction.
2. Push your expedition level as high as you can, to generate as much offline income as possible.
3. Build up your production buildings to the same level as your furnace, and upgrade them fully.

Bonus points for also upgrading your Shelters as high as you can, and upgrading them fully.

## Day 2+: Growing

The most important two things you will be doing for the next few days are keeping an eye on the health of your alliance, and growing your Furnace.

### Growing Your Furnace
Most activites in this game are gated behind specific furnace levels. These include:
- Furnace 4: Heroes and Exploration
- Furnace 6: Chief's Orders
- Furnace 7: Alliances
- Furnace 12: Drill Camp
- Furnace 19: Daybreak Island
- Furnace 25: Chief Gear
- Furnace 30: Fire Age upgrades

Pushing your furnace level up quickly **is** a viable strategy, however you have to ensure you have enough Coal production to keep up with
your furnace. 

### Maintaing Settler Health
One of the most annoying aspects of the early furnace levels is settler health. Once you are past Furnace 20 you'll never have to remember it, but until
then you'll need to ensure you're not overworking your settlers. Some easy ways to keep your settlers as health as possible:
- Keep your Shelters as high level as possible, with the maximum upgrades possible.
- Set your Cookhouse to serve the best food possible.
    - Click into the cookhouse.
    - Next to the Production section, click the yellow box.
    - <img src="/assets/guides/getting-started/cookhouse.png" alt="Cookhouse" style="width: auto; height: 400px;">
    - Set the Meny to Fancy Meal. This will cost you more meat, but keep settlers full and happy.
    - <img src="/assets/guides/getting-started/cookhouse-menu.png" alt="Cookhouse Menu" style="width: auto; height: 400px;">
- Keep your Clinic leveled up and upgraded to quickly fix sick survivors.
- When you unlock the Chief's house at Furnace 6, try to regularly use the Festivities order daily to keep settler happiness above 90%.

### Alliance Health
Alliance health is critical at this stage, because the helps that you get from an active alliance can make 20-30 minute constructions and researches
instant -- which will save you a ton of time.

Additionally, many events are alliance-based, so you will personally do better with a more active alliance.

### Trials Event
The Trials event is a 7 day solo event, where you receive 3 new categories of tasks every day. For completing everything, you unlock the hero Jessie.
Jessie is critical for a number of events such as Bear Trap, so make completing enough of these event tasks to unlock her a priority. If you miss you
you can still unlock her later, but it's more time consuming. The speed ups and other rewards you receive from completing each task are worth it at
the starting levels.

<img src="/assets/guides/getting-started/jessie-trials.png" alt="Trials Event" style="width: auto; height: 600px;">

### Rookie's Growth
Rookie's growth is an event that occurs only on new states. If you are joining an existing, established state you may not see it.

<img src="/assets/guides/getting-started/rookies-growth.png" alt="Rookies Growth Event" style="width: auto; height: 600px;">

### Troops
At Furnace 7, you will unlock the ability to train troops. At Furnace 14, you will unlock the ability to promote your lower level troops up to your
highest unlocked level. Before Furnace 14, just focus on constantly building the highest level troops you can. After you unlock promotion you should
always focus on promotion lower level troops up **before** you directly train your highest level troops.

Promoting troops from Level 1 to Level 5 will always be quicker and cheaper than directly training new troops at Level 5, because you
don't have to pay the portion of the cost or time for the Level 1 troops already existing. **PROMOTE BEFORE TRAINING**.
{: .alert .alert-danger}

Different events use different ratios of troops, so it's best to keep all 3 troop types training constantly. Once you get into higher furnace
levels your troops will take 10+ hours to train, so it's very easy to just log in twice a day and refresh your troop training. Until then,
it's a little more cumbersome but still very worth it.

Infantry is primarily used to defend, both yourself and your alliancemates. Marksman and Lancers are used to do damage. Lancers are typically
the most versatile, while Infantry become the most important later in the game.

Your initial goal should be to train enough troops that you can make out your marches. See the march section below for more details.

Troop levels unlock at:

| Troop Level | Furnace Level |
| :---------- | :-----------: |
| Level 1     | 7 (Infantry) & 8 (Lancer, Marksman) |
| Level 2     | 7 (Infantry) & 8 (Lancer, Marksman) |
| Level 3     | 7 (Infantry) & 8 (Lancer, Marksman) |
| Level 4     | 11  |
| Level 5     | 13  |
| Level 6     | 16  |
| Level 7     | 19  |
| Level 8     | 22  |
| Level 9     | 26  |
| Level 10    | 30  |

### Marches and Intel

At Furnace Level 7 you unlock the Lighthouse. The Lighthouse provides you with intel missions that refresh evey 8 hours. They come in 4 flavors:
- Rescue Survivors: A quick mission that gives you some free low level troops.
- Beast Hunting: Use a march (3 heroes + assigned troops) to kill a beast and get rewards.
- A Hero's Journey: Just like the regular exploration, but usually much weaker. 
- Bounties: Harder version of Beast Hunting. These will actually challenge you, so make sure you are strong than them.

Always do your intel missions. They are an invaluable source of Hero shards, XP, troops, and resources when starting out.
these missions. 

NOTE: Rescue Survivors and Exploration do not take march queue spots, so you can do them all at once while sending out a single Beast Hunt.
Don't spend on the extra march queue early, you get free ones from Research at TODO Furnace Level ##
{: .alert .alert-success}

One of the best things you can do to start off strong, is send your marches out on gathering trips when they aren't otherwise in use. You'll
probably want to gather Coal or Iron, as you will tend to run short on them first. You don't need to send 3 heroes, just the one Blue-rarity
hero that bonuses your specific gathering mission: Charlie for Coal, Eugene for Wood, Cloris for Meat, and Smith for Iron.
