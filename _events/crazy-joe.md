{: .subtitle }

Crazy Joe is a wave defence event. You don't have to be online to participate, but you will score considerably more if you are online.

Joe will send 20 waves to attack your cities and Alliance HQ, in a specific order.
- On Turn 10 and 20, Joe will attack your highest HQ.
- On all other turns, Joe will alternate between:
    - Attacking all cities in the alliance
    - Attacking cities for all **online** members of the alliance.

## Defending Against Joe

Contrary to what you way want to do, don't leave your troops at home. Instead:
1. Partner with someone with the same max troop level as you.
2. Trade with that partner a full rally that is made up of:
    - Sergei as the lead hero.
    - Any Lancer and Marksman heroes that are strong, but that aren't your best.
    - A 50/50 split of Infantry and Lancers, as many as you can send.
3. Take the rest of your Lancers and Infantry and either:
    - Send them to someone who is offline and has no other reinforcements.
    - Send **infantry only** to your Alliance HQ if you have T10.
    - Camp them in the wilderness or send them to gathering noes.
4. Leave all of your Marksman along with your 3 best heroes home.

The main goal of Crazy Joe is to be the one killing all of the bad guys in your partner's city, while your partner is the one killing
all of the bad guys in your city. This will give you the maximum number of points.

At no time should multiple people be reinforcing the same city, as it dilutes the points for all defenders.

## How Scoring Works

For every wave, the owner of the city will get 100% of points for all troops killed that attacked that city, **even if their troops did no damage at all**. 
This is why we send everything but Marksman away, to ensure the partner reinforcing us gets 100% of the kills and therefore all the bonus points. 

The reinforcements in the city get bonus points for the percentage and total count of attacking Joe troops they kill. These points are
never taken away from the City owner, but if more than one person is reinforcing a city the bonus points are split proportionally 
between all refinforcers. If you are the only defender and your troops kill all of the enemy troops because your partner didn't leave 
Infantry and Lancers at home, you get all the points.

NOTE: The city owner never gets bonus points for killing troops attacking their own city. If you have a partner, send your Infantry and
Lancers out into the wilderness or to another unreinforced city.

## Bonuses To Improve Joe Score

Joe scoring uses most of the same logic as the Bear Trap event: `higher level troops + higher level research + maxed island boosts = maximum Joe score.`

Bonuses that affect your Joe performance include:
| Boost Source | Type | Minimum Furnace Level To Max | Notes |
| Hero Level               | Troop Capacity   | 1  | Hero level correlates to how many troops each can support when you reinforce. |        
| Island: Rural Mill       | Infantry Attack  | 19 | |
| Island: Floating Market  | Infantry Attack  | 19 |  |
| Island: Warm Greenhouse  | Infantry Defense | 19 | |
| Island: Crystal Garden   | Lancer Attack   | 19 | |
| Island: Ampitheater      | Lancer Attack   | 19 | |
| Island: Sailor's Cottage | Lancer Defense  | 19 | |
| Island: Tree Of Life     | Troop All Stats + Capacity | 19 | |
| Boost: Troopy Deployment Capacity I | Troop Capacity | 1 | You can spend gems to get 10% troop capacity |
{: .table .table-strpied}

There is also a Deployment Capacity Boost II that gives you 20% instead of the 10%, but it costs 10x as many gems and isn't worth it outside of VERY important PvP battles. Unless you're rich, then yolo.

The level of your Heroes affect how many of your own troops you can send to rallies. They don't, however, affect the total capacity of a rally you start.

## Research

The three biggest research types you want to focus on, not in order, are:

| Research | Max Tier | Effect |
| :------ | :-------: | :----- |
| Weapons Prep         | VI | Troop Attack |
| Assault Techniques   | VI | Troops Lethality   |
| Lance Upgrade        | VI | Lancer Lethality   |
| Bulwark Formation    | VI | Lancer Defense      |
| Lancer Armor         | VI | Lancer Health      |
| Close Combat         | VI | Infantry Lethality |
| Defensive Formations | VI | Infantry Defense   |
| Shield Upgrades      | VI | Infantry Health    |
| Regimental Expansion | VI | Troop Deployment Capacity |
{: .table .table-striped}

Training skills can be tricky, because once you get into the higher tiers at higher levels they take a long time. It's usually best to train a lot of level 1 skills to open them all up as far as your Furnace level allows and then upgrade the target research in order of quickest to complete first.

It is also helpful to complete a significant amount of the Tool Enhancement I-VI (Research Speed Increase) in the growth tree. An upfront investment in training Tool Enhancement can give you a 30%+ Research Speed bonus. Again, it's worthwhile to open a significant portion of the Growth tree as Level 1 and then cherry-picking the shortest Tool Enhancement training to help snowball.

Finally, consider maxing out the common Natural Hot Springs in your Island. It provides up to 4% more research speed.
