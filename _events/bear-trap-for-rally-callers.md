*How To Stop Worrying And Start Loving That Thick Bear Booty*
{: .subtitle }

Your alliance leadership will usually be responsible for picking 5-10 of the strongest players to be dedicated rally callers.

The three most important things a rally caller brings to the table are, in order:
1. Capacity
2. Research Boosts
3. Hero Boosts

There is a lot of math and words below, so if you just want to be told what to do skip to the checklist at the bottom.

## Rally Capacity

You will get capacity normally through upgrading your buildings. For practical bear purposes, it caps at around a million. You increase your capacity through:

| Boost Source | Amount | Minimum Furnace Level To Max |
| :----------- | :-:    | :-:                   |
| Command Center | 840,000 | 30 |
| Island: Tree of Life | 4,000 | 19 |
| Island: Basic Dock   | 1,000 | 19 |
| Troopy Deployment Capacity Boost I | 10% of base | 1 |
{: .table .table-striped}


There is also a Deployment Capacity Boost II that gives you 20% instead of the 10%, but it costs 10x as many gems and isn't worth it outside of VERY important PvP battles. Unless you're rich, then yolo.

The level of your Heroes affect how many of your own troops you can send to rallies. They don't, however, affect the total capacity of a rally you start.

## Research

The three biggest research types you want to focus on, not in order, are:

| Research             | Max Tier | Effect                    |
| :------------------- | :------: | :------------------------ |
| Weapons Prep         |    VI    | All Troop Attack          |
| Assault Techniques   |    VI    | All Troops Lethality      |
| Lance Upgrade        |    VI    | Lancer Lethality          |
| Skirmishing          |    VI    | Lancer Attack             |
| Targeted Sniping     |    VI    | Marksmal Lethality        |
| Precision Targeting  |    VI    | Marksman Attack           |
| Regimental Expansion |    VI    | Troop Deployment Capacity |
{: .table .table-striped}

Training skills can be tricky, because once you get into the higher tiers at higher levels they take a long time. It's usually best to train a lot of level 1 skills to open them all up as far as your Furnace level allows and then upgrade the target research in order of quickest to complete first.

It is also helpful to complete a significant amount of the Tool Enhancement I-VI (Research Speed Increase) in the growth tree. An upfront investment in training Tool Enhancement can give you a 30%+ Research Speed bonus. Again, it's worthwhile to open a significant portion of the Growth tree as Level 1 and then cherry-picking the shortest Tool Enhancement training to help snowball.

Finally, consider maxing out the common Natural Hot Springs in your Island. It provides up to 4% more research speed.

## Heroes
For a Rally Captain you can significantly increase the damage of your whole rally by using the right heroes and having their key expedition skills maxed. Each hero has 2-3 Expedition skills that will affect every troop and hero in your rally, not just your own.

### Infantry Heroes

| Natalia | Effect |
| ------- | ------ |
| Queen Of The Wild | 5%-25% attack increase. |
| Call of the Wild | 5%-25% damage dealt increase. |
{: .table .table-striped}

Natalia is not F2P. You need to be VIP5 to get her to at least 4 stars, at which point you can get the two skills above to max level. Her gear bonuses infantry, so gear level and mastery isn't as critical for her for Bear as the other two hero slots. But infantry bonuses are the most critical for every other game mode, so it's worth gearing out one Infantry hero well.

**NOTE:** Natalia has a special skill called Ursus Strength, that increases with Star Level. This provides up to a 10% attack boost for all troops, even if she isn't with them. As such, starring her is helpeful even if you don't use her -- if you're willing to spend.
{:.alert .alert-primary}

| Jeronimo | Effect   |
| -------- | -- |
| Battle Manifesto | 5%-25% damage dealt increase. |
| Swordmentor | 5%-25% attack increase. |
{: .table .table-striped}

Jeronimo is even less F2P than Natalia. You need to be VIP10 to get him to at least 4 stars, at which point you can get the two skills above to max. His gear has the same caveats as Natalia, so I won't repeat them.

NOTE: Like Natalia, Jeronimo has a passive skill called Natural Leader that increases Lethality of all troops by up to 15% even when not with them. So Jeronimo provides a better passive boost than Natalia, but at a much higher spend cost.
{: .alert .alert-primary}

If you're spending on only one of these two for VIP, pick Jeronimo. He will last you through more seasons.
{: .alert .alert-warning}

|Flint |Effect  |
|----| ----|
|Pyromaniac | 25% chance of dealing 8%-40% damage per turn for 3 turns.|
|Burning Resolve| 5%-25% attack increase for all troops.|
{: .table .table-striped}

Flint only has a single skill that increases rally damage every time. He is similar to all of the Lancer and Marksman gold heroes in this way. So because of this he can theoretically do more damage than either Natalia or Jeronimo...but only if that 25% chance skill hits every turn. It's not worth it as a rally caller.

### Lancer Heroes

Your lancer heroes will each boost the stats of the Lancer troops that you deploy. Since lancers are used in nearly every game event,
they are worthwhile to invest in.

| Molly | Effect |
| :---- | ---- |
| Ice Dominion | 50% chance of increasing damage dealt by 10%-50% for all troops. |
| Youthful Rage | 5%-25% attack increase for all troops. |
{: .table .table-striped}

| Philly | Effect |
| :---- | ---- |
| Vigor Tactics | 3%-15% attack increase for all troops. |
| Dosage Boost | 25% chance of 20% to 100% damage increase for all troops. |
{: .table .table-striped}

As you can see, assuming you have bad luck on your skill chances Molly will do better consistent damage. But Philly can do higher peak damage. It's more or less a wash, so you should fall back to looking at the exclusive gear and star levels of the characters to decide who to use.

Note the wording on Philly's second skill. It gives them a "granting all troops attack a 25% chance of dealing X00% damage". It's not an increase, it's a multiplier. So the 120% to 200% multiplier range means it's an increase of 20% to 100% over your already base 100% damage.
{: .alert .alert-warning}

Exclusive gear can give you up to 60% lancer lethality for either hero. The head and feet gear also provide Lancer Lethality boost. So whoever you want to invest more in for starring and exclusive gear, use that one. Since we've had Molly longer, i'd suggest her.
{: .alert .alert-success}

### Marksman Heroes

|Alonso| |
| ---- | ---- |
| Poison Harpoon | 50% chance of increasing damage dealt by 10%-50% for all troops. |
{: .table .table-striped}

|Zinman| |
| ---- | ---- |
| Positional Battler | 5%-25% increase in damage dealt for all troops. |
{: .table .table-striped}

Zinman is objectively better. You'll only get about 50% value out of Alonso, which makes him equivalent to Zinman in bonus but a single run of bad luck makes him worthless. Zinman is consistent.

That being said, Alonso has exclusive gear that increases all troop Lethality by up to 15%. So if you're willing to spend on him and his exclusive gear, he becomes competitive. He's also critical for pushing the PvP Arena ladder -- if you plan on spending for Arena use Alonso in Bear. If you don't, use Zinman. We'll get a better Marksman hero anyway in future seasons.

## Rally Caller Checklist
#### Heroes
- If you aren't spending: use Flint, Molly, Zinman
- If you are spending: Jeronimo is better than Natalia, Natalia is better than Flint.
- Get your chosen heroes to at least 4*, and max their damage+lethality expedeition skills.

#### Research
- Open up as far as you can realistically in Combat tree.
- Train skills from shortest time to longest time once you've opened a bunch.
- Focus on: Weapons Prep > Assault Techniques > Regimental Expansion > Lance Upgrade > Precision Targeting
- Sprinkle in Growth Tree's Tool Enhancement for faster research returns.

#### Island
- Max Natural Hot Springs first for Research Speed increase.
- Max Basic Dock for troop rally capacity increase.
- Get Tree maxed.
- Upgrade Lancer and Marksman and Infantry Attack and Defense buildings.

#### Boosts
- Use them if you can afford them. They are 2k gems each.
- Order of importance: Troop Attack > Troop Lethality > Rally Capacity.
- That's 6k total gems per bear, if you want to commit to it.
